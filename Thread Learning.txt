üß© Module 1: Java Threading Fundamentals (Recap)
Creating threads: Thread, Runnable, Callable

Thread lifecycle: NEW, RUNNABLE, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, BLOCKED, TERMINATED

Thread methods: start(), sleep(), join(), interrupt()

‚úÖ Exercise: Implement a multi-threaded program with 3 threads printing messages concurrently.


üîí Module 2: Thread Synchronization
Race conditions

Synchronized methods/blocks

Intrinsic locks and monitor concept

volatile vs synchronized

Thread-safe class design

‚úÖ Example: Bank account balance update using multiple threads (with and without synchronization).

‚úÖ Challenge: Create a class-safe shared counter that is incremented concurrently by 100 threads.



‚öôÔ∏è Module 3: java.util.concurrent Core Components
ExecutorService, Executors

Callable, Future, invokeAll, invokeAny

Thread pools: FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, ScheduledThreadPool

CompletionService

‚úÖ Example: Submit tasks to a thread pool and collect results with Future.

‚úÖ Challenge: Build a thread pool that downloads pages in parallel and returns content size.




üß± Module 4: Locks and Advanced Synchronization
ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock

tryLock() and lock fairness

Condition objects (wait/notify replacement)

StampedLock for better performance

‚úÖ Example: Producer-consumer using ReentrantLock and Condition.

‚úÖ Challenge: Build a read-write data structure using ReadWriteLock for concurrent access.




üö¶ Module 5: Coordination and Communication
wait(), notify(), notifyAll()

BlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue

CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier

Semaphore, Exchanger, Phaser

‚úÖ Example: Use CountDownLatch to wait for multiple services to initialize.

‚úÖ Challenge: Simulate a multi-player game start using CyclicBarrier.



üõ†Ô∏è Module 6: Concurrency Utilities
ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, Atomic* classes

LongAdder, DoubleAccumulator

ThreadLocal vs InheritableThreadLocal

ForkJoinPool, RecursiveTask, RecursiveAction

‚úÖ Example: Parallel sum using ForkJoinPool.

‚úÖ Challenge: Use ThreadLocal to store transaction context in concurrent request handling.




‚ö° Module 7: Reactive & Virtual Threading (Loom)
Introduction to Project Loom (Java 21+)

Thread.startVirtualThread(...)

Structured concurrency

Comparison: platform vs virtual threads

‚úÖ Example: Create 100,000 virtual threads (without OOM).

‚úÖ Challenge: Build a reactive-style HTTP client using virtual threads.



üß™ Module 8: Debugging & Tuning
Thread dump analysis

Deadlock detection & resolution

Performance tuning (GC, thread starvation)

Java Flight Recorder & VisualVM

Lock contention analysis

‚úÖ Exercise: Create a deadlock and resolve it using ordered locking.
